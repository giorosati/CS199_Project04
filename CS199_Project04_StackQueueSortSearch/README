Project 4 README
CS_199_400_W2016


The program can be compiled by typing “make all” in the directory containing the uncompressed files from the rosatig.zip archive. 

*****  Please use my included moster parent and derived classes.

Make will look for the following files:
proj4.cpp
myLL.cpp
myStack.cpp
myQueue.cpp
node.hpp
monster.cpp
dragon.cpp
firedragon.cpp
goblin.cpp
icedragon.cpp
troll.cpp

and an executable file named “prog” will be created in the same directory.
