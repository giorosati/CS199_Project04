Project 3 README
CS_199_400_W2016


The program can be compiled by typing “make” in the directory containing the uncompressed files from the rosatig.zip archive. 

*****  Please use the proj3.cpp file in my zip file as I had to add the following so the attack
functions work properly:
#include <time.h> 
srand(time(0));

The makefile will look for the following files:
proj3.cpp
node.hpp
myll.cpp
monster.cpp
dragon.cpp
firedragon.cpp
goblin.cpp
icedragon.cpp
troll.cpp

and an executable file named “prog” will be created in the same directory. 

Any object files that were created can be removed by typing.

Three things I found difficult:
1) Struggled with how to implement a Struct as part of a Class
2) Finding time to write descriptions for functions
3) Creating a new project in Visual Studio that imports existing code
from gitHub.

Three things I learned:
1) How to use a struct within a class for a linked list
2) How to create a new project in Visual Studio that imports existing code
from gitHub.
